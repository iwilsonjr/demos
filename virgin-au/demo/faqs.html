                  <h2><em>Q:</em> How do I choose the right type of travel insurance?</h2>

                  <p>It depends on where you plan to travel, the overall cost of your trip, as well as the extent of cover you desire. If you're planning a luxury trip overseas, you'll likely want our Comprehensive premier policy. If you are travelling abroad on a more modest budget, the Essentials value policy may be best for you. Our basic policy is designed with domestic travellers in mind. If you need help deciding on the type of cover you need, call 1800 888 777.</p>

                  <h2><em>Q:</em> How do I determine the total cost of my trip?</h2>

                  <p>Total up all of the pre-paid and non-refundable costs associated with your trip. This might include the cost of airfare; accommodations; and tours, events or excursions that you will have paid for prior to the start of your trip. If you are unsure of your exact trip costs, try to estimate them as accurately as possible. However, you should err on the side of over-estimating rather than underestimating your costs.</p>

                  <hr />

                  <h2><em>Q:</em> Can I get cover if I have an existing medical condition?</h2>

                  <p>In many cases, yes, but it depends on your particular situation. Our policies automatically cover many existing medical conditions (please refer to the Combined FSG/PDS for details). Some of these are covered for free, and some may require an extra premium to be paid. In certain cases, we are able to issue a policy for people with existing conditions that excludes medical benefits. In this case, you will be covered for things such as trip cancellation, but you would not receive emergency medical benefits. For more information, please contact us at 1800 620 119.</p>

                  <hr />

                  <h2><em>Q:</em> When does my policy start?</h2>

                  <p>Your trip cancellation benefits start when your policy is issued. All other benefits, such as emergency medical and dental coverage, begin on the date of your departure (as listed on your policy).</p>

                  <hr />

                  <h2><em>Q:</em> What if I change my mind?</h2>

                  <p>If you decide you do not want your travel insurance policy, you have a 15 working day cooling off period during which you may return it. As long as you have not already travelled or made a claim on the policy, you will receive a full refund--no questions asked! Need to modify or cancel your policy? Call 1300 72 88 22 or email us.</p>
